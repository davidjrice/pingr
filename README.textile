Pingr is a Ruby library for accessing the Pingdom API.  It provides a thorfile so you can execute its actions from the command line.

h2. Requirements

Install the soap4r and thor gems.

h2. Usage

You will need to create a "creds.yml" file in the pingr directory.  It should look like:

:username: someemail@example.com
:password: YourPingdomPassword
:api_key: 13c9a18ee27cafebabe4a72dead3beef

Obviously replace your email/login, password, and Pingdom API keys appropriately.

Use thor to call the various actions.  Try "thor -T" to see the available items from within the pingr directory.  For example:

  thor pingr:checks

to get a list of your Pingdom checks.
